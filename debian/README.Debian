README for mapserver's debian package
=====================================

This build of mapscript PHP extension can't be load as a 'cgi-fcgi' module for
stability reason, but only with PHP as an apache DSO. If you need the cgi-fcgi
support, feel free to build your own package but note that according upstream
it will not be stable.
