mapserver (5.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this version Mapserver integrates the AGG 2.4 library. This functionally
  identical to the 2.5 already integrated in Debian but it has a BSD license which
  is compatible with the Mapserver one. 
  The library package is included as a uuencoded archive starting from the 2.4 official
  tarball with the following changes applied before creating the archive:
   * Non DFSG-compliant code in GPC has been removed.
   * The autogen.sh script has been changed and launched in order to generate 
     building scripts in maintainer mode for autotools once. You need to have
     libsdl1.2-dev and all other build-deps installed before running it.
     This will avoid the whole autotools chain build-dep requirement
     for mapserver.
